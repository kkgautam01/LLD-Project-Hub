## Develop a Java application for an OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming platform that allows users to watch TV shows organized into seasons and episodes.

#### Design and implement a system such that:
1. When a user finishes watching an episode, the next episode of the same season automatically starts.
2. If the user finishes the last episode of the current season, the first episode of the next season (if available) should automatically begin.

#### Requirements:

1. Define suitable classes to represent seasons and episodes.
2. Implement logic to determine and load the next episode or season.
3. Handle edge cases such as the last episode of the last season.

#### AutoPlay
1. Standard: Play from Season 1 to Season N.
2. Specific Season: Start from provided season.
3. Resume playback: Resume where the user left off.
